Metro rail part - add in orange, airport symbol at top left where lines go off map. Possibly add Tri-Rail words or icon w/arrow. Note: Orange line is too similar in color to MetroMover Brickell Loop. Change the latter color. MetroRail word should be in black ink preferably with its symbol or use only its symbol in black ink. Differentiate Miami River from Bay possibly with darker color or waves or river edges. Move the street names to edges, if you feel the need to keep them. Be more concise with words. \"Transfer\" is sufficient but if you want to keep \"to Inner Loop\" (or other loop) use the symbol for transfer. Google Transportation Icons if necessary to find something that may indicate what looks like transferring to international visitors / illiterates. Use universal or visual symbols for key visitor locations - Arsht Center /Omni (or Arsht / Omni Center) like the Sydney Opera House; AA Arena like the Guggenheim; Freedom Tower like those cute colorful touristy attractions maps. The station name for Adrienne Arsht Center needs to have Omni in it somehow as 1) many residents still call it Omni 2) the bus terminal there is called Omni and doesn't show on all maps 3) websites like the Miami Passport Agency use Omni in their wording. Possibilities: Adrienne Arsht / Omni Center or Adrienne Arsht Center / Omni.  End General Comments. Start of comments relating to maps on opposite side. remember, change the yellow to a color that can't be mistaken for the MetroRail orange line. Text across top of maps - cut out direction text as redundant and clutter. Arrows tell us that info. Cut out \"Serves\" as unnecessary. Call Knight Center \"Knight Conference Center\" or \"Knight Center /Conference\" to distinguish from Arsht's Knight Concert Hall. Occasional Loops (Outer and Full Loop) should be distinguished from other loops either shading or under a heading Occasional Loops. End those comments. Start station text comments: Headings: Cut to \"Omni Loop Stations\", Brickell Loop Stations\",  \"All Loop Stations\". Underline station names. Distinguish buses, trolleys, etc. with different color fonts and/or icon. Change Adrienne Arsht Center name as mentioned above. END.",
