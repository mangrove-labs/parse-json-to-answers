Show me how you would use this map to plan a route to that location.- Where would you first get on public transit?- Where would you get on the Metromover?- Which Metromover station was the closest to your destination?     -- How did you know it was the closest?
 - Jasmine: Starting from the Government Center, look for the Metromover that says Omni and take it to Bayfront Park and continue to the Omni stop. After pointing out that we are at the Eighth Street station, Jasmine said she would take the Metromover north and transfer at the Knight Center stop to the Metromover loop to Omni.
 - Christophe: Coming from Omni Station, I would get on the Adrinne Arsht Center and usually change at College North to the Brickell Loop, and get off on Eighth Street Station. 
 - James: Skipped
 - Serina: I usually take the bus to the Omni Station to Downtown Miami at the Government Center
 - Fletcher: Omni/Adrian A to College North
 - Karina: Wolfson campus
B bus to finanical mover station
Brickell to college north
 - Subfwayuser: Take my scooter or bike to Adrienne Arsht and take the Omni Loop to one of the stations to switch to the Brickell Loop and get off a the Financial District. 
 - GR: Musuem park
Walk to arsht
Can on the omni loop
 - Jessica: Going to the Government Center, it would take Brickell Loop eleven stations, or transfer to the Inner Loop at the Knight Center, or seven stops. 
 - Glyn: Bayfront Park
Brickell Loop 8th St. Go to Bayfront Park exite
 - professional: Where is the starting point? (I said I dont know). We will take this building as a starting point (700 Brickell). I can go to Freedom Tower station or Park West station. I would take Omni loop. Final destination stop is Government Center. It's written on the map. (User AND proctor mistook incorrect 7th street on the map- correct starting point is Eighth Street stop on Brickell Loop). 
 - Beth w: Arhst
Eighth street
Brickell loop to governement center and transfer to inner loop
 - Tito: Perez Art Museum taking Brickell Loop to Knight Center, transferring to the Omni Loop. 
 - Kdh: Eight street mover
Brickell loop to bayfeont park

 - Fabiola: Brickell. Simply take Metromover from Eigtht Street south on Brickell loop.  Used the legend.
 - techie: Starting from current location- 700 Brickell. (Tester is looking at loop page). Start off at Eighth Street station and it goes counterclockwise to Govt Center. Closest to destination is Govt Center. On the list of Government Buildings it shows the Miami-Dade County courthouse is at Government Center. 
 - Elmo: Bayfront park
 - Luis: Luis worked for US1 Parking when it was the Omni. So, he would board the Brickell Loop north to the Knight Center and transfer to the Omni Loop. 
 - 26yo part time worker and student: Miami Dade Wolfson Campus is destination, starting from 700 Brickell. Would get on Brickell Loop. The Eight Street Station on the Metromover Brickell loop. College/Bayside station is closest to destination. I could tell by the address of NE 4th Street on the map.

How could the map be improved to make this process easier?
 - Jasmine: Jasmine said she listens to the announcements within the Metromover for information on the route, but would like to have the pamphlets with routes available within the Metromover cards. 
 - Christophe: Christophe did not under the loops and directions when first got here. For instance, the three layer overlay similar to mall maps. 
 - James: Skipped
 - Serina: Make the print larger.
 - Fletcher: Mover map/list at ground level - w/landmarks
 - Karina: Besides colors 
Different size loops
Acurrate distance relations
 - Subfwayuser: The Gold of the Metrorail is too similar to the Yellow of the Brickell Loop. Also, two Loops are blue, so make one Red and the other Blue, and make the Loop names the same as the colors since visitors do not know what the names refer to. ("Use the universal language of Metros") Also, maybe make South Bound and North Bound Routes. 
 - GR: Focus on downtown only 
Color code the brickell loop a different color
 - Jessica: Maybe making the station dots more apparent, maybe red instead of white. 
 - Glyn: It's ok
 - professional: Yes. I would make the North arrow more prominent in a bold color at the top. Mistake of wrong starting point leads to a suggestion about making Brickell Ave more prominently marked on the map. The two 7th Street is easy to mix up. 
 - Beth w: Which loop takes you the attraction 
 - Tito: No suggested improvements
 - Kdh: None
 - Fabiola: Simplify the legend. Symbols for stations can get confusing. Show stations serving a single loop for all loops.
 - techie: It could have icons or symbols, like a courthouse so you could easily see landmarks.
 - Elmo: Easy
 - Luis: The map is pretty well set up, particularly with the color coding and the information on the side bar. 
 - 26yo part time worker and student: I saw that the map on the other side has the individual loops, but when you put together on the map, it gets confusing with the different colors, so it would be beneficial to have individual loop maps.

How did you know it was a Metrorail station?
 - Jasmine: Jasmine regularly rides the Metro Rail. 
 - Christophe: Christophe has taken the Metrorail from there. 
 - James: Skipped
 - Serina: Because of the Rail Icon, but Serina takes the train to airport every day. 
 - Fletcher: Bigger circle

Now, show me how you would take the Metromover from Tenth Street Promenade to Government Center. ... How many stations did you pass through (not including the origin or destination)?...Did you make any transfers? (Yes or no)    ...If Yes, How did you know you could transfer there?
 - Jasmine: Jasmine initially through that the Brickell Loop would go left but that realized that the Metromove would go right and she would need to pass nine stops. 
 - Christophe: Take the Brickell Loop to Knight Center Station, switch to the Inner Loop for two stops, more than the initial four. 
 - James: Skipped
 - Serina: Brickell Loop to Government Center, without making any transfers, or transfer at Third Street. 
 - Fletcher: Go to Knight Center, switch there to inner loop.  Six stops.
 - Karina: Take the brickell loop
 - Subfwayuser: Get on at Tenth Street Station and transfer to the Inner Loop at Knight Center (even though the name on the map is far from the actual station)
 - GR: Same loop color stops at grovenment center 
Ride the whole loop around 
 - Jessica: Take Brickell Loop and transfer the the Inner Loop at Knight Center
 - Glyn: Take mover to Knight Center station. Transfers to inner loop to Government Center.  6 Stops
 - professional: I pass through 9 stations. I do not make any transfers.
 - Beth w: Brickell loop all the way round to governemnt center
 - Tito: Take Brickell Loop north and transfer to the Inner Loop at Knight Center
 - Kdh: Option 1 full brickell loop
Option 2 bickell loop to knight center then catch inner loop
 - Fabiola: Did not transfer, nine stations.
 - techie: I think Brickell loop goes both ways, so you would pass through two stations. (User indicates going directly using brickell to the left branch up to Govt Center). Government Center serves all three loops so you should just be able to go up through three stops. (Indicates Fifth Street, Riverwalk, Third street)- and the fourth would be Government Center.]
 - Elmo: 10th street to Knight Center to Governemnt Center 6 
 - Luis: Brickell north until you get to the Government Center.
 - 26yo part time worker and student: 8 stations going through on the Brickell Loop. No transfers. (User indicates going around to the right around the whole brickell loop). I just realized I could use a transfer and got there quicker. I saw the little round thing at Knight Center that serves multiple stations. And I could transfer to the Inner Loop, and then it would have been 5 stops.

How could the map be improved to make these processes easier?
 - Jasmine: No suggestions; just pay attention to the announcements. Jasmine has had to assist tourists with directions before, and agree that having the next station indicated on the Line Map inside the car. 
 - Christophe: 
 - James: Less busy
 - Serina: Make the map bigger.
 - Fletcher: See previous answer
 - Karina: To much numbers 
To small of numbers
We should Know our demographics

 - GR: Make a poster for when it hAppens at all stations
 - Jessica: No other suggestion
 - Glyn: Self explanatory arrows show direction
 - professional: 
 - Beth w: Skip
 - Tito: Maybe add a fourth color on the main map to show the Full Loop. 
 - Kdh: List all destinations by alphabetical order by color of loop
 - Fabiola: Add the inner loop to the full loop
 - techie: They need to have arrows that go both ways.
 - Elmo: Continue to use Full Loop
 - Luis: The Full Loop goes by almost every station and it is easy to follow. 
 - 26yo part time worker and student: Definitely the color for the Metrorail, should not be yellow. Green with another color.

Without transferring, show me how you would take the “Full Loop” from Brickell station to College North.... How many stations did you pass through (not including the origin or destination)?...Did you make any transfers? (Yes or no)    ...If Yes, How did you know you could transfer there?
 - Jasmine: 7, without any transfers. Jasmine was familiar with the use of Full Loop when there are problems on the line. 
 - Christophe: 
 - James: When brickell and omni become one map
 - Serina: I would transfer at Knight Center to the Inner Loop based upon the white dot and directional arrows. 
 - Fletcher: Do you know what he Full Loop is - Yes.
Didn't have any problems identifying how to use the Full Loop:
Suggestions for names: Long Service; Extended Route 
 - Karina: Yes the full loop is the whole loop
 - Subfwayuser: 9
 - GR: Does not know what the full loop is
 - Jessica: 21 without any transfers, or 9 stops by transferring at Knight Center. 
 - Glyn: Yes.
 - professional: 
 - Beth w: Skip
 - Tito: Tito was aware of the Full Loop. Take the Full Loop to the School Board until it comes back, or take the Full Loop to the Knight Center and transfer to the Inner Loop. Tito did not attempt to go the wrong way on the Full Loop. 
 - Kdh: 11
Went the right way 
 - Fabiola: Northbound to college bayside & walk to college north or take the full loop all the way to school board and come back. Saw the connection option with more recent map with inner loop inside full loop
 - techie: 15 stations. (User follows black line all the way around to the top of School board, then counts College North as  15). No transfers- Just went around counterclockwise. 
 - Elmo: Yes.  Transfer at Knight Center to inner loop to College North
 - Luis: Luis would with take the Full Loop always to Omni and back to College North, or get off at College Station and walk over to College North.
 - 26yo part time worker and student: Yes- its the whole thing. (Tester looks on map page- I show Tester the back with the Full Loop description-- "oh I forgot there was a back page"). Take the Brickell Loop up 5 stations to Knight center, transfer to the Omni Loop, and then take 3 stations to College North. (Indicates going clockwise around inner loop to College North). I knew I could transfer by the Knight Center Icon on the map that its a station serving multiple loops.

Do you notice any differences?
 - Jasmine: Jasmine noticed the streets are not displayed on the proposed design, but streets did not provide much help and makes the map more confusing. 
 - Christophe: 
 - James: Simpler with less importnat information
 - Serina: The alternative is easier to read but lacks the bus information. 
 - Fletcher: Yes.
 - Karina: Cleaner 
Less information
 - Subfwayuser: The alternative is clearer but still need the colors normalized, and the stations need ellipses instead of circles to show that the station is valid for all lines. 
 - GR: The new map is too simple
Tne new mao would useful with added street numbers 
There is context to referenece too
 - Jessica: The Alternative Map is easier to read. 
 - Glyn: Alternate map easier to read, except for arrows.  Add some of the elements from the original map, minimal streets/main streets, less background information
 - professional: 
 - Beth w: Less information 
Diffferent curve of the train and mover
 - Tito: The Alternative Map is clearer because it only has the information that is necessary. 
 - Kdh: Cleaner 
Distinction between mover and rail
No mention of loop names on map
 - Fabiola: Alternate map is clearer. Needs major streets indicated. Arrows look like a design on the alternate map, mover direction not clear.
 - techie: Gaps between the metrorail and metromover. Arrows are not there. Station with connections symbol- station with white circle vs green which is downtown express station but idk what that means.  There's more contrast. You don't see the actual streets that are nearby. 
 - Elmo: Original has more detail
 - Luis: The Alternative Map has brighter colors and does not show the street names, which is important. 
 - 26yo part time worker and student: Yes- I don't see the map on the new one. I don't see the availability of the Bus or other transit options. That's about it.

Which design do you like better (and why)?
 - Jasmine: Jasmine preferred the proposed design. 
 - Christophe: 
 - James: The current one
 - Serina: Serena prefers the alternative because she already familiar with public transportation, through a visitor might want the additional information in the pamphlet. 
 - Fletcher: Proposed design. Cleaner design; easier to read; incorporate major streets, not all.
 - Karina: The names need to bigger
 - Subfwayuser: Diane preferred the alternative design because it is simpler. 
 - GR: A little bit of both 
 - Jessica: The Alternative is better because it is simple and easy
 - Glyn: See prevous answer
 - professional: 
 - Beth w: The new one 
Easier on the eye
 - Tito: Tito likes the Alternative Map better because it is does not have extraneous information such as the street names. 
 - Kdh: The arrows on the old map are not clear
The new map makes it more understandable 
 - Fabiola: Original better. Likes to have the street names. 
 - techie: It's similar, but its more of an overview on the new one. If I had to pick I'll pick the first one because there's more detail. People need to know the streets. You need to know NE or SE. Major intersections.
 - Elmo: Original because it has more detail; streets/intersections
 - Luis: Luiz prefers the Platform Map is he know how far from is destination each station is. 
 - 26yo part time worker and student: The new one seems clearer and less cluttered, but it doesn't have the map, or the other information. I would say the first/original one is more user-friendly. 

Is there anything you would take from this map and add to the previous map?
 - Jasmine: Jasmine rely on Google Maps once you are off the Metrorail or Metromover, so the street information is extraneous. 
 - Christophe: 
 - James: Less busy but keep importnat info
 - Serina: Nothing, because Serina uses the MDT app if she needs to connect to a bus. 
 - Fletcher: See previous question
 - Karina: Change the arrows
 - Subfwayuser: Remove the bus information since buses are available at every station and the bus information alone is insufficient. 
 - GR: The simpliness
 - Jessica: Use the Alternative Map on the Pamphlet instead. 
 - Glyn: Yes - see previous answer
 - professional: 
 - Beth w: No
 - Tito: Maybe bus information, though it would complicate the Platform map. 
 - Kdh: Add the bus and other information on a side bar
Add bus tranfer information to announcements 
 - Fabiola: Smaller circles on the lines, no multiple loop station indicators.
 - techie: The landmark on metrorail (historic overtown). The stations with connections window. That's about it. 
 - Elmo: Add original map detail to proposed map
 - Luis: Luiz prefers the Platform Map because he likes the additional details. 
 - 26yo part time worker and student: I like the way the routes are. You can tell the difference between the Metrorail and the Brickell Loop, it's thinner and you can tell the difference. 

Thanks, that was very helpful. If you’ll excuse me for a minute, I’m just going to see if the Designers have any follow-up questions they’d like me to ask you.
 - Jasmine: 
 - Christophe: 
 - James: N/a
 - Serina: 
 - Fletcher: Designers asked questions - recapped what was liked/changed
 - Karina: List of the cover all the transit transfer
Change the size the names
More information need to be said when there is an issue
 - Subfwayuser: 
 - GR: Change the color coding of the loops 
The 311 number next tto the help line 
Add the backside for app information 
Add more information about easy pay 
Tourists the airport / grove / airport / beach
And how do they all connect
 - Jessica: Nothing to ask. 
 - Glyn: N/A
 - professional: 
 - Beth w: 
 - Tito: 
 - Kdh: Light up board for tourists and locals 
 - Fabiola: Nothing to ask.
 - techie: Nothing to add.
 - Elmo: NA
 - Luis: Luis would like at least some of the street names. 
 - 26yo part time worker and student: Nothing to add.

Proctors only: List the three most serious usability problems you observed.
 - Jasmine: 1. Lack of reliance on the map 
 - Christophe: 
 - James: Busy map
Color coding
Icons
 - Serina: Serina did not have any usability issues. 
 - Fletcher: Brochure cluttered
Full loop 
Better wayfinding
 - Karina: Letter size
Use more of the map to show the map
Use different colors for attractions
 - Subfwayuser: Directional arrows too small,  colors too similar, station names too long
 - GR: Telephone listing
App info in the back
Coloring coding 
 - Jessica: Direction arrows are too small, the station indicators are not obvious enough (red dots would stand out). 
 - Glyn: Too much background info
Colors between Orange line and Brickell Loop(printed brochure)
Landmark info on map is distracting - remove.
 - professional: 
 - Beth w: Directions to attractions 
For example arsht is the omni line 
 - Tito: The schism of combining Omni and Brickell into the Full Loop. 
 - Kdh: Color of map system
Metrorail is to much on top of the metromover 
List all the destinations 
 - Fabiola: 1 - lack of clarity 2 - directional arrows not prominent enough 3 - full loop was completely new concept
 - techie: Direction of the metromover. How transfer would work. Seeing the symbols and arrows.
 - Elmo: Leave original as is.
 - Luis: Luiz was experienced with the Metromover system, though does not ride it frequently. 
 - 26yo part time worker and student: Noticing where transfer locations are. Colors-- the yellow of the Metrorail is confusing with the Brickell Loop yellow.
